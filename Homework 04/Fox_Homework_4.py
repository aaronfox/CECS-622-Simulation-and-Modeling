    # null hypothesis that the generated data follows
    # the uniform distribution specified by Excel. We can therefore reject
    # the alternate hypothesis that the generated data in Excel does not follow
    # the random uniform distribution specified by Excel.

    # https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/chi-square.aspx. Since a p-value less
    # than or equal to 0.05 is statistically significant, it shows that there is strong
    # evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis, indicating that there is less than a 5% chance that null
    # hypothesis is correct. As such, we can REJECT the
    # null hypothesis that the overall distributions of this year and last year follow 
    # the same distribution and are not statistically different. We can therefore ACCEPT
    # the alternate hypothesis that the overall distributions of this year and last year
    # do not follow the same distribution and are statistically different.
