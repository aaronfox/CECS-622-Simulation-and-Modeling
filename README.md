# CECS-622-Simulation-and-Modeling
A repo containing some of my work for my CECS 622 Simulation and Modeling of Discrete Systems Course

Some of the things I've done:

## Monte Carlo Pi
#### This was a method of estimating the value of pi by randomly throwing darts at a circle within a square. This was built using Python, PyQt5, and Matplotlib

## 3D Space Pursuit Simulation
#### This simulation simulated some smart space commanders which chased each other and would destroy the other ship if they were within a specified input α angle and β distance. This was built in the Unity game engine using C#

## Inventory Modeling for a Fictional Store
#### This was a model of a fictional store with various uniform random purchase requests, a Gaussian distribution of customer purchases, and variable inputs allowing the user to visualize the results of the simulation with a line chart and a bar chart; it sure felt like I was an Industrial Engineering major during this project.
